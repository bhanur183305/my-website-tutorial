Python supports several built-in data types that allow you to store and manipulate different kinds of data. Here are some common data types in Python along with examples:

---
# Python Data Types
 
1. **Numeric Types:**
   - `int`: Represents integer values.
   ```python
   age = 25
   ```

   - `float`: Represents floating-point values.
   ```python
   pi = 3.14
   ```

   - `complex`: Represents complex numbers.
   ```python
   z = 2 + 3j
   ```

2. **Sequence Types:**
   - `str`: Represents a string of characters.
   ```python
   name = "John Doe"
   ```

   - `list`: Represents an ordered collection of items.
   ```python
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   ```

   - `tuple`: Represents an ordered, immutable collection of items.
   ```python
   coordinates = (10, 20)
   ```

3. **Mapping Type:**
   - `dict`: Represents a collection of key-value pairs.
   ```python
   person = {"name": "John", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}
   ```

4. **Boolean Type:**
   - `bool`: Represents the truth values `True` or `False`.
   ```python
   is_active = True
   ```

5. **None Type:**
   - `None`: Represents the absence of a value.
   ```python
   result = None
   ```

6. **Set Types:**
   - `set`: Represents an unordered collection of unique elements.
   ```python
   unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   ```

   - `frozenset`: Represents an immutable set.
   ```python
   frozen_numbers = frozenset({1, 2, 3})
   ```

These are just some of the commonly used data types in Python. Each data type has its own properties, methods, and operations associated with it. Understanding and effectively using these data types is essential for writing Python programs.
